v0.9.21 - 2014-02-22
--------------------

### Features and improvements ###

 - The preferred package description file name is now "dub.json" instead of "package.json" (which is still supported)
 - Revamped command line help now shows detailed help for each command
 - Added `dub test` to run the unit tests of a package using a custom main() function
 - Public sub packages can now (and are recommended to) reside in sub folders
 - Added ruby style `~>` version specifications: `"~>1.0.2"` is equivalent to `">=1.0.2 <1.1.0"` and `"~>1.3"` is equivalent to `">=1.3.0 <2.0.0"`
 - `--annotate` now works for all commands
 - Added a `--force-remove` switch to force package removal when untracked files are found in a package folder
 - Added a `"mainSourceFile"` field to better control how `--rdmd` and `dub test` work
 - The target binary (if any) is now automatically deleted after a linker error to avoid partially linked binaries
 - Added `--force` to `dub build` and `dub run` to force recompilation even if already up to date
 - Renamed the "debug_" and "release" build options to "debugMode" and "releaseMode" to avoid the D keyword clash
 - Renamed the "noBoundsChecks" build option to "noBoundsCheck" to be consistent with the corresponding build requirement
 - `dub init xxx vibe.d` now emits a `-version=VibeDefaultMain` as required by the latest versions
 - Reimplemented the VisualD project generator to use the new compile target logic
    - Instead of `dub generate visuald-combined` use `dub generate visuald --combined`
    - Properly handles the explicit library target types (those other than `"targetType": "library"`)
 - Added support for `dub add-local` without an explicit version argument (will be inferred using GIT) (by p0nce) - [pull #194][issue194]
 - Added a new "release-nobounds" build type
 - Improved the error message when "dub remove" fails because of a missing installation journal
 - Removed the Mono-D project generator - use Mono-D's built in DUB support instead
 - Added support for public sub packages in sub folders - this is the preferred way to use sub packages, see <http://code.dlang.org/package-format#sub-packages>
 - Only "main.d"/"app.d" or "packname/main.d"/"packname/app.d" are now automatically treated as `"mainSourceFile"` for executable targets and none for library targets
 - Excessive/unknown command line arguments now result in an error
 - The "checking dependencies" message on startup is now a diagnostic message
 - A `"dflags"` entry of the form `-defaultlib=*` for DMD is now passed to the linking stage for separate compilation
 - Added simple support for `--arch=x86` and `--arch=x86_64` and LDC
